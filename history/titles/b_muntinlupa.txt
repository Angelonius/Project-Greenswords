2395.8.8={# The fort of Muntinlupa had fallen to Velasquez forces. During the siege, Prince Fernando had dismounted from his horse and led the vanguard to climb the walls of the castle using a siege ladder. Upon climbing the walls, Prince Fernando had led his infantry vanguard to vanquish the defenders and open the gate. Prince Fernando then ran back to his horse and rode it into the castle. After much fighting, Prince Fernando and King Alejandro had managed to make Prince Bonito II bend the knee and relinquish control of the castle to the king.
